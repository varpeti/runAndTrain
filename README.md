# Run And Train

This python app helps to create datasets in real time to train a Neural Network.
Using my [classit](https://github.com/varpeti/classit) neural network project, and the [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) GUI interface.

In theory it can be attached to any type/form of Neural network, just repleace the ```Create.main(...)```, ```Classit.main(...)```, and ```Train.main(...)```. 


## import link2*

## Os: Linux

In theory it can be used under **Windows**/**OSX** just delete/repleace the ```.wm_attributes('-type', 'splash')``` rows.

## Test

The diceTest.html is a fun litle game to test this app.
